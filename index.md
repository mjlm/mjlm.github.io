_Primary thesis project:_ I am interested in how the hierarchy of regions in mammalian cortex transforms and combines sensory inputs to extract action-relevant information. I use <a href="http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/pdf/minderer2016.pdf" target="_blank">virtual navigation tasks for mice</a> designed to engage cognitive processes. I then compare the information present in the activity of large populations of neurons recorded across several cortical regions during the task.

_Neural encoding models:_ Using deep learning methods, I develop models that relate animal behavior to simultaneously recorded neural activity.

_Software tools for neuroscience research:_ I develop software to collect, analyze and present neuroscience data. For my thesis project, I developed 3D virtual environments for mice and tools to coordinate two-photon microscopy and simultaneous optogenetic stimulation. Together with Selmaan Chettih, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/HarveyLab/Acquisition2P_class" target="_blank">tool</a> to identify neurons and their time-varying activity in imaging data. I also created our <a href="http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">lab website</a>.
