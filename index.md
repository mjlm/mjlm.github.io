* * *

## Education
*   **PhD in Neuroscience**, Harvard University (2012--2018)<br>
*   **MSc in Neuroscience**, ETH Zürich (2010--2012)<br>
*   **BA in Natural Sciences**, University of Cambridge (2007--2010)<br>

## Research experience

_2018--present_<br>
**Google AI Residency**, Google Brain Cambridge, MA, USA<br>
The <a href="https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency/" target="_blank">AI Residency</a> is a research training role similar to a postdoc.
* Unsupervised representations for video prediction
* Model-based reinforcement learning
* Semantic segmentation of medical images

_2012--2018_<br>
**Program in Neuroscience**, Harvard University, MA, USA<br>
Thesis advisor: Dr. Christopher Harvey<br>

_Primary thesis project:_ I studied how the mammalian cortex transforms and combines sensory inputs to extract action-relevant information. I used <a href="http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/pdf/minderer2016.pdf" target="_blank">virtual navigation tasks for mice</a> designed to engage cognitive processes. I then compared the information present in the activity of large populations of neurons recorded across several cortical regions during the task.

_Neural encoding models:_ Using deep learning methods, I developed models that relate animal behavior to simultaneously recorded neural activity.

_Software tools for neuroscience research:_ I developed software to collect, analyze and present neuroscience data. For my thesis project, I developed 3D virtual environments for mice and tools to coordinate two-photon microscopy and simultaneous optogenetic stimulation. Together with Selmaan Chettih, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/HarveyLab/Acquisition2P_class" target="_blank">tool</a> to identify neurons and their time-varying activity in imaging data. I also created our <a href="http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">lab website</a>.

_2012_<br>
**Institute of Neuroinformatics**, ETH Zürich, Switzerland<br>
**Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics** Tübingen, Germany<br>
Advisors: Dr. Kevan Martin and Dr. Jason Kerr (shared project)<br>
_Master thesis:_ Two-photon calcium imaging in awake rats during a forelimb motor task.

_2011_<br>
**Brain Research Institute**, University of Zürich, Switzerland<br>
Group: Neurophysiology, Dr. Fritjof Helmchen<br>
_Research project:_ Chronic imaging of cortical sensory map dynamics.
